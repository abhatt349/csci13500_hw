Phase 1
User enters a word, and the program only reports pronunciation as a list of phonemes.
Pseudocode
1) Take user input and capitalize it
2) Loop through the textfile
3) For each line, split line on spaces and compare the beforestring to the user's input
4) If the beforestring and user input match, then print the afterstring
